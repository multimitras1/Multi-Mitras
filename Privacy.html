    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>At <strong>[Your Website Name]</strong>, we value your trust. Protecting your privacy is our top priority. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and safeguard information when you access our website and use our online tools. By using our services, you agree to the terms of this policy.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We believe in transparency. Our website is designed to be as privacy-friendly as possible:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No Personal Data Collection:</strong> We do not ask for your name, email, phone number, or address to use most of our tools.</li>
      <li><strong>Local Processing:</strong> Most tools run directly in your browser, ensuring your data never leaves your device.</li>
      <li><strong>Uploaded Files:</strong> If a tool requires uploads (e.g., PDF, Image), files are processed securely and are never stored on our servers after processing.</li>
      <li><strong>Anonymous Data:</strong> We may collect non-identifiable technical data such as browser type, operating system, and general usage statistics to improve performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Collected Information</h2>
    <p>We only use collected information to improve user experience:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To operate and maintain our free online tools.</li>
      <li>To monitor website performance and fix errors.</li>
      <li>To understand how users interact with our website so we can improve functionality.</li>
      <li>To ensure fair use and prevent misuse of our services.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Storage & Security</h2>
    <p>Your data security is extremely important to us:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Files processed by our tools are temporary and automatically deleted after processing.</li>
      <li>We use secure HTTPS (SSL) connections to protect data in transit.</li>
      <li>We do not permanently store personal or uploaded data on our servers.</li>
      <li>We implement industry-standard safeguards to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Use of Cookies</h2>
    <p>Our website may use minimal cookies to improve functionality, such as saving tool preferences (e.g., dark mode, language settings). We do not use cookies for tracking or advertising purposes.</p>

    <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Currently, our website does not display third-party advertisements. However, in the future, if we integrate trusted services such as analytics or ads, they may collect limited anonymous information as per their own privacy policies. We will update this policy if that happens.</p>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our tools are safe for everyone. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If you believe your child has provided personal information, please contact us so we can remove it.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>You can choose to not upload any personal files.</li>
      <li>You may clear cookies and cache from your browser anytime.</li>
      <li>If we ever store optional data (like feedback forms), you can request deletion anytime.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
